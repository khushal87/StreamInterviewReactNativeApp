## :dart: About

This Project is a part of the assignment given by the company **Stream**. This is to be built on React Native.

## :sparkles: Features

### ðŸ¥… Basic features

- Fetching all the random users on real-time using the API https://randomuser.me/api?results=20
- Pagination on scroll. This is implemented within Flatlist.
- The users are presented in the form of Card showing the essential details such as _Name, Avatar/Image, Phone number_.
- When we long press a card, a overlay/modal opens up showing the detailed view of a User. The background is transluscent.
- This is implemented without using any external library. The Modal opens up `onLongPress` event of the Pressable which is wrapped over the user.
- As long as the user is pressing on the screen, the modal stays active. Once released, `onPressOut` event is called and the modal closes.
- The application is built considering the latest standards of both **React and React Native**.
- The logic of the component is built over **React hooks**.
